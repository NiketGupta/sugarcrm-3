=====================

A Java client library to interact with the Sugar CRM REST API.

Motivations 
-----------
This library is born out of a need to interact with Sugar from Java with as few 
dependencies as possible so as to make it very easily embeddable in a variety 
of applications on server and client side. 

Sugar is a large system and this library focuses on support for just the APIs 
that are needed making no attempt to be complete (at least for now). If you need
another API please get in touch.  

Finally, there is a CrmService interface which _may_ allow other CRM systems 
to be accessed using a common client API. This is not the main focus of the 
library at this time but could perhaps be developed in the future.
